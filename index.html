    <h1>Security Training — This was a simulated phishing test</h1>
    <p>Hi — you were part of a controlled security awareness exercise run by <strong>[Your Org Name]</strong>. No real credentials were used (if you entered anything, it will be handled securely as part of training).</p>
    <p>Why this test? Phishing is one of the most common ways attackers gain access to systems or data. The aim of this exercise is to help you spot suspicious emails and learn what to do.</p>
    <h3>Quick tips</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Check the sender’s email address carefully.</li>
      <li>Hover over links before clicking; verify the target domain.</li>
      <li>Look for mismatched logos, typos, or urgent requests for credentials.</li>
    </ul>
